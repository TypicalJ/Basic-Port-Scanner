# Basic-Port-Scanner

This repository contains a set of basic port scanning scripts written in Python. These scripts are educational tools to demonstrate fundamental concepts in network reconnaissance and client-server interaction.

## Contents

- `BannerGrabber.py`: Connects to a remote host and attempts to retrieve service banners.
- `Scanner.py`: Scans a target host for open ports.
- `Server.py`: Simple socket server for use with penetration testing exercises.
- `Client.py`: Connects to the server, simulating a basic client for testing purposes.

## Usage

Ensure you have Python 3 installed.

```bash
python BannerGrabber.py
python Scanner.py
python Server.py
python Client.py
